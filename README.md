The Cafe Management System is a full-stack application designed to manage the operations of a cafe. It integrates both the frontend and backend in a single repository to facilitate easy management and deployment. The frontend is developed using Angular, while the backend is built with Node.js and Express, with data stored in a MySQL database. This system helps to manage products, orders, and bills, as well as handle user authentication, email notifications, and more.
